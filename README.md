👨🏻‍🏫 This is an example program for Create, Read, Modify, Delete, Search records in a Sqlite database in Xojo language. It works by presenting as an example a customer search list and a customer management form. This program integrates a database data abstraction layer allowing easy modification and increased adaptability to your needs.

🤖 This example goes further than a simple CRUD type program. It notably incorporates numerical field entry controls and data entry modification controls. You can use this example to build your future applications. There is also all the management, opening, creation, closing of an SQLITE database.
You can consider this program as a kind of structure on which all sqlite database management applications in xojo can be based.

🛟 The application code is commented to make learning easier. Everything has been done to make the code as adaptable as possible.

Created with Xojo 2024 release 4.2, using API 2.
